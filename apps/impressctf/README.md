# The Crucible of Hackers 🏴‍☠️
### The History of CTFs, Red vs. Blue Teaming, and Open-Source Cyber Ranges
*An interactive 3D [impress.js](https://impress.js.org/) presentation.*

Inspired by the Tekromancy article: **"The Crucible of Hackers: The History of CTFs, Red vs. Blue Teaming, and Open-Source Lab Frameworks"** (`blog/src/content/blog/history-of-ctf-red-blue-teaming.md`) by Joshua Edward McLaughlin Cox.

## 🛠️ Architecture & Special Effects

- **Core Engine:** Vendored [impress.js](https://impress.js.org/) with CSS3 3D transforms (`translate3d`, `rotateX`, `rotateY`, `rotateZ`, `scale`).
- **Dynamic Background Canvas (`js/cyber-canvas.js`):** Multi-layered perspective grid, drifting hex tokens (`0x90`, `FLAG{`, `eBPF`), and interactive constellation nodes with vector links.
- **Procedural Audio Synthesizer (`js/audio-fx.js`):** Pure Web Audio API synthesizing 3D warp whooshes, terminal clicks, and alert sirens with zero external audio assets.
- **HUD Overlay (`js/presentation.js`):** Glassmorphic top and bottom bars with live progress tracking, station title readout, autoplay timer, and jump selector.
- **Terminal Simulator:** High-fidelity CRT terminal windows with color-coded commands, parameter highlights, and simulated bash/docker traces.
